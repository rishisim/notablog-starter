I wanted to memorize several hundred words (500 to be exact). However, a majority of the words I donâ€™t know the meanings of, not even the roots of the words. But, when I tried to find the definitions, I had to look for the menings of the words one by one. To look for the meaning of words a hundred times by searching up the words a hundred times is very tedious. The general process is that I have to search up a word, click a link to a website, copy the definition and input it back to excel. Then I have to repeat the process all over again. If I can automate it, I can do it for as many as words as possible So, I had an idea. Why not put all the words in excel, input all those words into a python program, and the program will output the definitions of those words all at once? With this in mind, I created a function that takes a list of words, extracts the definitions, and puts all the definitions back into excel (Explained in more depth below). I encourage you to use this program or you can modify it as well."]]},{"children":[],"uri":"https://www.notion.so/eadf2523e1744f9996428db5634dd931","type":"heading","createdTime":1659319644913,"lastEditedTime":1659468180000,"title":[["Overview - A Python Multiple Input Dictionary"]],"depth":1},{"children":[],"uri":"https://www.notion.so/3d1d803d63464f85b6b5f95807285a0e","type":"text","createdTime":1659319620000,"lastEditedTime":1659319620000,"title":[["A basic Python Dictionary in JupyterLab that can take multiple words and output the definitions of those words at once.
